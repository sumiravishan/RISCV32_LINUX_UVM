RISCV Linux Boot Simulataneous with uvm model - For Reference and Educational purposes
  supported
      RV32AMI CORE
      Customized uvm components 
	  Fully parameterized design and verification environment
	  Easy extendable ( parameterized ) to run Millions of simulation cycles simulation with different applications
  Simulator
      Xilinx xsim free simulator ( 2021 or later ) 
	  Easy setup to convert to other commercial simulator
	  Use gtkwave to open the waveform file which is free and fast
	  
  Limitations:
	  Interrupt and Traps need to be improved
	  Single Cycle Execution

  folder
    ./src         : SystemVerilog UVM riscv designs
    ./hex         : Include linux hex
    ./sim         : Run folder with file list and Makefile


How to run:

1. set up your test env
  1.1 Make sure to install simulator and gtkwave or change the Makefile and filelist options according to the simulator requirement

  1.2 Go to sim folder and execute any make target after clean


2. how to run example
  cd sim
  execute run commands
